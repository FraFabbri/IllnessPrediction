# IllnessPrediction
In this work we try to reproduce for Italy the results achieved in the article 'Wikipedia Usage Estimates Prevalence of Influenza-Like Illness in the United States in Near Real-Time': in this case, the aim of the experiment is to try to study and predict the time series of the influenza-like illnesses, through the timeseries of the pageviews on the related Wikipedia pages. The data of the illness have been collected through the Italian flu surveillance program called 'Influnet'.
